I'm the owner of "I Love You by Tricio",

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I set up a Minnesota food producer, 
Cottage Food Producer business, 

4
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which means I make food at home to sell at

5
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
different events.

6
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So Deaf Equity is having an event on 
October 23rd.

It will be at Charles Thompson Hall (CTH).
