		%p I understand that I am volunteering my time at DBRIB to support DeafBlind Participants. The number of DeafBlind participants we accept GREATLY depends on every volunteerâ€™s full commitment to the entire duration of the retreat. In exchange for my time, I will be provided training and experience on DeafBlind etiquette, human guiding, providing visual and environmental information.
