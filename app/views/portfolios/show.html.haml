				%h2 Introduction
		
				%p My name is Patrick Vellia.  Until recently, this website was built on WordPress, which I haven’t updated since 2017.  However, in October 2022 my contract was up with my hosting provider and thus, I decided to not renew, and build out the new site from the ground up.  This site is actually an extension of the DeafBlind Support and Access Network’s (DBSAN’s) Web application by adding two endpoints—one on their subdomain and one here at www.theroadwithoutbarriers.com and both are exactly the same point of entry.

				%p DBSAN is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity organization founded during the COVID-19 pandemic to help keep DeafBlind individuals connected in a period of darkness.  This portfolio documents much of my work done to build the DBSAN platform.

				%h2 Project 1: Generate a Ruby on Rails Application
				%p This project demonstrates the basic initial steps I take to start a new Rails project.  It includes the following:
				%ul
					%li Define Bootstrap 5 as the default front-end CSS3 and JavaScript framework for the asset pipeline
					%li Define PostgresQL as the database used by ActiveRecord
					%li Tell Rails to use UUIDs by default when generating new models
					%li Convert all of the .erb files to .html.haml by way of the haml-rails gem.

				%h3 Generate the app with Bootstrap and PostgreSQL
				Rails makes it easy to generate new projects. Let's call this project <code class="language-bash">myapp</code>.  First, open a Terminal, Command Prompt or Powershell shell interface and navigate to the directory you would like to start your project in.

				Then, run the following command:

				%pre.mt-4.mb-4.language-bash.line-numbers
					%code
						rails new myapp -d postgresql --css bootstrap
				%p After that's done, we want to move into our new directory by running:

				%pre.mt-4.mb-4.language-bash.line-numbers
					%code
						cd myapp

				%p Before we can start the server, we first need to tell Rails to actually create the database for us:

				%pre.mt-4.mb-4.language-bash.line-numbers
					%code
						rails db:create

				%p And we can tell the app is working by running:
				%pre.mt-4.mb-4.language-bash.line-numbers
					%code
						rails s

				%p Go to your favorite browser and type in the URL http://localhost:3000.  This takes you to port 3000 on your local machine.
