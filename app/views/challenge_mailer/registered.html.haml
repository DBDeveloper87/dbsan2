%p Hello #{@name}!

%p Let’s get moving!

%p Thank you for your interest in joining DBSAN’s first Exercise Challenge! By joining us, you are helping us raise awareness about DeafBlind people, and supporting our mission of educating people about and exposing people to DeafBlind people and our culture.

%p December’s Exercise Challenge is to do 15.5 hours of exercise for the month. That’s equal to 30 minutes each day. You don’t need to do it all at one time!  You can break up the 30 minutes into 2 or 3 shorter segments in one day.  You can do more exercise some days if you know you can’t exercise other days, aiming for 15.5 total hours for the month.  You can even do more than 15.5 hours if you want!  It’s all up to you!

%p What are some exercise ideas? Walking on a treadmill, outside, or in a mall; riding a bike; doing yoga or martial arts; dancing; playing sports; and much more! The goal is to get up and MOVE!

%p A half hour of exercise a day keeps us in shape, and 30 minutes of exercise a day is proven to reduce depression and anxiety.  This challenge will allow us to motivate and support each other in reaching a group exercise goal!
