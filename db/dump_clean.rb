When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, many who are DeafBlind were increasingly being isolated. In order to mitigate this isolation, we started as a simple support group through through the Zoom Video Conferencing Platform in order to stay connected and share our experiences. Through this modest beginning, we have grown into what we are today.", published: true},

After much consideration, we added our new colors to the logo. It starts with a globe that rests in the crook of the arm. The globe is criss-crossed with interconnecting lines symbolizing our networking and consecutiveness, while the arm and hand symbolize our support and access through touch. With a gradient rainbow we represent a diverse group of people with dual sensory loss from every walk of life as well as our support of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual (LGBTQIA+) community. Below our symbol are the letters DBSAN in English and then again in Braille below that.", published: true}
