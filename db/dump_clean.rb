The globe is criss-crossed with interconnecting lines symbolizing our networking and consecutiveness, while the arm and hand symbolize our support and access through touch. With a gradient rainbow we represent a diverse group of people with dual sensory loss from every walk of life as well as our support of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual (LGBTQIA+) community.
